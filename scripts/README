This package loads precomputed trial masks that describe the environment about the moth frame by frame. A scoring function is applied to this set of masks to yield a score value that allows multiple sets of masks to be contrasted.

The main module can open either csv or hdf files. Since the traj and env data are loaded as Pandas DataFrames, the x,y columns in traj are expected to be called "pos_x" and "pos_y". For env data, the columns should be labeled ['x','y','r'].
