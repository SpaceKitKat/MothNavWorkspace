   background
      use an example:
      what are some navigational challenges in robotics?
      how are bio systems good at solving these challenges?
      how can we study these systems? yoyo's experiments
      how can these studies inform us on how to solve these challenges in robotics?

   problem addressed/ question
      In crowded environments, what visual cues contribute to an animal's navigational decision-making?

      How can we capture, or even predict, an animal's intent based on recorded behavior when it is navigating a crowded environment?

   analysis/design
      use a function to map a trajectory/environment to a quantity (score)
      which can be compared to other trajectory/envs
      the function is a kernel determined by visual chars hypothetically observed by the animal (i.e. distance, relative heading, optic flow, etc)
      the kernel is applied over a subset of the environment that is centered around each point of the traj
      the result of this operation is accumulated along the traj path as the score

   implementation
      python numpy and pandas modules were used to store and manipulate traj/env data
      how was data loaded
      how was a frame obtained
      how was that frame discretized
      how was the kernel genereated
      inner prod kernel and frame
      visualisation/debugging

   results

   future work
      genetic search for best function
      for a set of functions:
      generate scores for artificial set and data set
      compare the distribution of artificial traj/envs to traj/envs to determine how well the function distinguishes the two categories
      generate new functions from top k funcs and repeat
